  <p>Hope for Children is a certified charity, serving residents throughout all fifty 
    states mainly focusing on ending child abuse and abuse to others.
    
    Our goal is to redesign the Hope for Children website to convey their 
    valuable mission and activities in a more clear, concise, and enticing manner
    in order to motivate individuals to donate, volunteer, or spread the word about
    Hope for Children initiatives.
    
    Our team gathered qualitative data from 5 or more user interviews and website
    testing. Quantitative data was gathered through a survey sent out via email and
    social media over a period of 2 days.</p>
<section class="Research">Research</section>
<p>Our team will research and redesign the navigation, 
    Layout, UI to help better convey their purpose and 
    Raise awareness to protect children from domestic 
    Violence and sexual assault.
    
    Test Plan 
    We asked the user to complete tasks that encompassed 
    the user flow steps and demonstrate the following: 
    1. Learn more about the Hope for Children organization 
    and what they do
    2. Determine what the organization specifically does to 
    help fight child abuse
    3. Sign up to Volunteer
    4. Donate to a special cause
    5.Find examples of how Hope for Children has helped 
    specific individuals or families </p>
<section class="ProblemStatement">Problem Statement</section>
<p>The Hope for Children Foundationâ€™s website is unclear in its goal, outdated in its 
    aesthetics, and could use more clarity and organization with the information.
    And Our user is wary of unknown non-profit organizations, though he sometimes donates 
    to select causes, is overall unlikely to volunteer his time. Currently, he does not feel he 
    can trust organizations and their online platforms and is hesitant to dedicate more 
    resources to causes.</p>
